# Spotcast Configuration

This guide walks you through the setup of Spotcast in Home Assistant. The setup has three parts:

1. Create a Spotify Application (or reuse the one from the official Spotify integration).
2. Start a small relay server on your computer (only needed during setup).
3. Run the Spotcast config flow in Home Assistant.

> [!WARNING]
> Why is a relay server needed at all? Some Spotcast features require permissions that Spotify only grants to its own applications. During setup, Spotcast therefore authenticates one session under the identity of the official Spotify desktop application, and the relay server is needed to hand that authorization over to Home Assistant. Because this method is not officially supported by Spotify, it may stop working without notice if Spotify changes its authentication systems.

## Prerequisites

- A **Spotify Premium** account.
- Home Assistant `2026.4` or newer, with Spotcast [installed](../../README.md#installation).
- A computer with a web browser. The relay server (step 2) and the browser used to complete the setup (step 3) **must be on the same computer**.

## 1. Create a Spotify Application

> [!TIP]
> If you configured the [Spotify](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spotify/) integration in Home Assistant, this step is very likely already done and all you need is the Client ID and Client Secret of the application.
>
> You can set up a secondary application if you want, but this is not necessary.

In order to work with certain parts of the API, Spotcast requires access to the Spotify API through a personal Spotify Application. You can follow [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spotify/#create-a-spotify-application) from the official Spotify integration to create one. In short:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create an app.
2. In the app settings, add `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` as a **Redirect URI**.
3. Keep note of your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for step 3.

## 2. Start the relay server

In order to add the desktop application credentials from Spotify, we must redirect the connection information from your local computer to Home Assistant. This can be achieved by using a relay server on your local computer. This step is necessary because Spotify does not allow (for understandable security reasons) desktop credentials to be redirected to another location than the device making the connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the relay server on the **same computer** where you will complete the setup in your web browser, and keep it running until the setup is done. It is only needed during setup (and later for reauthentication).

Please follow the instructions for your specific operating system:

### Mac OS/Linux

<details>
<summary>Mac OS/Linux Instructions</summary>

> ℹ️ **Note**
>
> This server setup requires you to have a recent Python interpreter on your computer. You can install Python with the installer provided by [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or by using the package manager of your distribution ([homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is available for MacOS).

#### One-Step setup instructions

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mincka/spotcast/main/scripts/relay_server.py | python
```

> ⚠️ **Caution**

```

</details>

### Validation

Once started, the relay server confirms it is listening. The Python server shows:

```text
Relay server running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/login
Redirecting to: https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth
Press CTRL+C to quit the server when done
```

The PowerShell server shows:

```text
Relay server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/login
Target redirect URL: https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth
Open the Spotcast integration setup in Home Assistant.
(Press Ctrl+C to cancel.)
```

If you see a similar message, you're ready for the next step.

> [!TIP]
> If the server fails to start because port `8080` is already in use, stop the application using that port and start the relay server again.


## 3. Setup the Spotcast Integration in Home Assistant

Open Home Assistant and go to: `Settings -> Devices & Services -> + ADD INTEGRATION -> Spotcast` or use this direct link:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spotcast)

Follow these instructions to finalize the setup in Home Assistant:

### 3.1 Application Credentials

> [!TIP]
> If you already made a Spotcast configuration in the past on this server, this step will not be required and you can skip to [3.2](#32-public-oauth-authorization).
>
> If your application credentials for your Spotify Application changed and you need to edit them, Home Assistant doesn't offer you that option when setting an integration with existing application credentials. You need to remove the current credentials manually, which can be done by following [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/application_credentials/#deleting-application-credentials) from Home Assistant.

Once you see this window below in Home Assistant, provide a name (to your discretion) and provide the Client ID and Client Secret from your Spotify Application created in [Step 1](#1-create-a-spotify-application).

![Application Credential Step Screenshot](../../assets/images/docs/spotcast_configuration/3_1_application_credentials.png)

### 3.2 Public OAuth authorization

This step will authorize your account in your Spotify Application. A new window will appear asking you to link the account to Home Assistant. Ensure the `Your instance URL:` points to your current Home Assistant server and press the `Link account` button.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the correct account is signed in. If Spotify doesn't ask you to log in, it is because a Spotify account is already signed in. If you are trying to set up an account for someone else in your household, make sure their account is the one signed into the browser.

### 3.3 Desktop Token authorization

A new window will open looking like this:

![Desktop Credential Approval](../../assets/images/docs/spotcast_configuration/3_3_desktop_token.png)

If the account under `Spotify for Desktop` is the account you are trying to set up, press the `Continue to the app` button, otherwise press `Not you?` and connect the proper account.

> [!CAUTION]
> If the relay server is not running at this point the setup will fail.

The same window as in step [3.2](#32-public-oauth-authorization) will appear. This is normal. This is to redirect your desktop credentials to Home Assistant. You can press the `Link Account` button.

### Done

At this point you should see your Spotify devices and account start to populate in the Home Assistant window.

> [!NOTE]
> You have completed the Spotcast setup at this point. You can close the relay server by pressing `CTRL+C` in your terminal. The relay server will only be required again for reauthenticating.

## Optional: Relay Server Configuration

Both relay servers (`relay_server.py` and `relay_server.ps1`) can be configured using CLI arguments to fit specific needs.

| Argument              | Description                                                                          | Default                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-r` `--redirect-url` | Redirects OAuth to your Home Assistant server (if not using `my.home-assistant.io`)  | `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` |

### Example: One-Step Install with Custom Redirect (Python)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mincka/spotcast/main/scripts/relay_server.py | python - -r http://<your-home-assistant-server>
```

### Example: Manual Script with Custom Redirect (Python)

```bash
python relay_server.py -r http://<your-home-assistant-server>
```

### Example: Custom Redirect (PowerShell)

When piping the script with `iex`, set the `$redirectUrl` variable first; when running the downloaded file, use the `-r` argument:

```powershell
$redirectUrl = "http://<your-home-assistant-server>"
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mincka/spotcast/main/scripts/relay_server.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
```

```powershell
.\relay_server.ps1 -r http://<your-home-assistant-server>
```
